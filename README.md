# Global COVID-19 Impact Analysis â€“ A Data-Driven Investigation

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the global impact of COVID-19, integrating key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccinations, government stringency, and smoking prevalence. The analysis aims to understand how these factors influenced COVID-19 outcomes, particularly exploring the correlation between male smoking rates and COVID-19 mortality.

## Objective

- Analyze global COVID-19 trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Explore the relationship between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 death rates.
- Understand geographical and temporal patterns in COVID-19 spread.
- Support health policy development and risk management strategies through data insights.

## Data Sources

- Global COVID-19 datasets (cases, deaths, vaccination rates, testing).
- Smoking prevalence data (male and female) by country.
- Stringency index data reflecting government restrictions and lockdowns.

## Key Metrics

| Metric                   | Value     |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Total Cases              | 308 Million |
| Total Deaths             | 5 Million |
| Cases Per Billion        | 15.68 Million |
| Fully Vaccinated         | 2.22 Billion |
| Average Stringency Index | 45.74     |

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and interactive data visualization.
- **Excel** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.
- **Python (Pandas)** for advanced data wrangling and correlation analysis.

## Dashboard Features

- **Geographical Analysis**  
  Visualizes COVID-19 impact by continent and country, including total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

- **Temporal Trends**  
  Tracks changes in cases, deaths, and testing over time, highlighting peaks during late 2021 to early 2022.

- **Stringency Analysis**  
  Examines how different countries managed lockdowns and restrictions through the Stringency Index.

- **Smoking vs Mortality Correlation**  
  Scatter plot showing the relationship between male smoking rates and COVID-19 deaths per 100K population.

- **Interactive Filters**  
  Users can filter by continent, country, time period, and other variables for detailed analysis.

## Key Insights

- **Highest Cases** were recorded in Europe (29M) and Asia (28M), followed by North America (23M) and South America (15M).
- **Lower Cases** in Africa and Oceania, possibly due to effective containment, underreporting, or lower testing.
- Countries with **higher male smoking rates tend to show higher COVID-19 death rates**, highlighting smoking as a risk factor.
- Nations like Germany, Myanmar, and Canada maintained higher stringency measures.
- Vaccination efforts significantly contributed to the decline in new cases post-2022.

## Business and Policy Implications

- **Public Health:** Countries with high smoking prevalence should prioritize respiratory health initiatives alongside COVID-19 measures.
- **Risk Assessment:** Businesses in high-risk regions should consider enhanced health protocols and workforce contingency planning.
- **Healthcare Demand:** Increased need for respiratory healthcare services in countries with high smoking-related COVID-19 mortality.
- **Policy Development:** Governments should integrate anti-smoking campaigns with pandemic response strategies.

## Recommendations

1. Implement targeted health campaigns combining vaccination and smoking reduction efforts.
2. Strengthen public health policies addressing smoking as part of pandemic preparedness.
3. Encourage businesses in high-risk areas to adopt enhanced health benefits and remote work options.
4. Monitor ongoing data on comorbidities like smoking to improve future pandemic responses.
